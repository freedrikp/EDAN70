The main task of the project was to make a robot identify certain elements in its surroundings, for example, doors, chairs, tables, humans, e.t.c.

\vspace{10pt}

Thus we divided the project into three parts:

\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item{Create a parser for the laser range data and transform the data into a more suitable coordinate system}
\pause  
\item{Develop an algorithm that can classify laser range measurements}
\pause  
\item{If time is available, port the programs into ROS (Robot Operating System)}
\end{itemize}
\pause
Offline data to be used during development and if ported into ROS maybe test on online data.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Laser Range Data}
\framesubtitle{Parser}

The laser scanner took measurements with 4-5 Hz. Each measurement was stored in the following format:
\begin{verbatim}
<unknown> <unknown> <number_of_points> <timestamp_seconds>
<timestamp_microseconds> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown>
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <angle_between_points>
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown>
<distance_in_meters>^(number_of_points)
\end{verbatim}

1 measurement = 1 line
\\
1 round of measurements = 1 file

\pause
\vspace{10pt}

The parser yields polar coordinates which are hard to work with.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Laser Range Data}
\framesubtitle{Transformation}

When we have parsed the measurements we transform the data from polar coordinates to our own cartesian-coordinates.

\pause
\vspace{10pt}

The robot is located at (0,0) and the robot forward is along the y-axis.

\pause
\vspace{10pt}

Having this coordinate-system makes it much easier to plot the data for us to visually analyze the measurements as well as to process the data.

\pause
\vspace{10pt}

For instance, we can use well-known algorithms and mathematical formulas to interpolate the data or find patterns in the data.

\frametitle{Algorithm}
\framesubtitle{Approach}

We are both very interested in the Machine Learning division of Artificial Intelligence.

\pause
\vspace{10pt}

Therefore, our original vision was to try to implement the classifier using unsupervised learning. Thereby letting the classifier improve itself.

\pause
\vspace{10pt}

However, we eventually realized that we needed to use supervised learning in order to have a starting ground.


\pause
\vspace{10pt}

Eventually we had to only use supervised learning as we had to change the way the whole classifier was going to work.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[shrink]
\frametitle{Algorithm}
\framesubtitle{Directly Comparing Measurements}

The first approach that we tried to implement was the following:

\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item{Maintaining a list of measurements and their classifications}
\pause
\item{Have some kind of algorithm that directly compares two measurements}
\pause
\item{Using the above algorithm to find the best match in the maintained list}
\pause
\item{Assign the same classification of the best match to the new measurement}
\pause
\item{Add our newly classified measurement to the list}
\end{itemize}

\pause
This approach combines supervised and unsupervised learning. We must have a starting list, this is supervised learning, and as the list grows we have unsupervised learning.

\pause
\vspace{10pt}

However, this approach has some problems.

\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item{Difficult to find an algortihm to compare measurements}
\pause
\item{Since the list grows, the classifier can introduce small errors that will accumulate}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
